 * Base interface for resolvers in the MCP (Model Context Protocol) system.

 * Specialized resolver interfaces extend this base interface to provide
 * specific resolution strategies for different capability types:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link ToolsResolver} - Resolves tool capability requests</li>
 *   <li>{@link ResourceResolver} - Resolves resource capability requests</li>
 *   <li>{@link ForwardResolver} - Resolves forward proxy requests</li>
